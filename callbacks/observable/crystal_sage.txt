Crystal Sage

The preacher twins, known better as the Crystal Sages, arrived in Lothric at an 
unknown time, along with numerous magics. They were said to be the successors, 
or at least the spiritual successors of the legendary "Big Hat" Logan, the Vinheim 
sorcerer who studied the paledrake, Seath the Scaleless, and his learnings, which 
lead to Logan's records of Crystal Sorcery, which the Sages would continue to study 
throughout their whole lives, and it appears that they eventually set up shop at 
Lothric's Grand Archives.

The Scholars of the Grand Archives, under the spiritual direction of the twins, maintained a 
dangerous store of knowledge, some of which being similar to what drove both Seath and 
Logan mad, forcing them to take measures such as coating their heads and clothing with 
wax to avoid similar madness. Their favorite student during this time was a woman named 
Kriemhild, and they gifted her with one of their spherical catalysts, fixed to the end of 
a stick to create a staff.

Eventually, in a pact of uncertain terms, one of the Sages joined the Undead Legion of 
Farron to teach them sorceries, though how this affected the relationship between the 
twins is not made certain. As the Legion believed in speed over power, the Crystal Sage 
created spells that were practical and could be used relatively faster than other sorceries, 
but required and encouraged the development of specific talent. The daughter of the 
Legion's lead acolyte, a xanthous scholar named Heysel, appeared to have had some of her 
own sorceries tailored in such a way.
