Pontiff Sulyvahn

Though almost nothing is certain in the main game, Ashes of Ariandel reveals that Sulyvahn 
was born in the Painted World of Ariandel. Despite being born and raised inside the painting, 
he had not yet experienced the loss or despair that most residents of the painting had prior 
to their arrival, which resulted in them being drawn into it. As such, he had no meaningful 
connection to the Painted World, and subsequently went on an indefinite pilgrimage outside 
the painting to the wider world, forsaking the frost sorceries that Ariandel had pioneered 
in favor of more esoteric magic.

At one point, the young frost sorcerer found the Profaned Capital below a tundra some distance
from Irithyll, and the Profaned Flame with it. Taking the Profaned Greatsword along with his 
ambition, he set out to control Irithyll. He eventually accomplished his goal through subterfuge 
against the Darkmoon Knight, and used his Pontiff Knights to maintain control in Irithyll 
while the Outrider Knights were sent to conquer faraway lands. To make sure the Outriders never 
betrayed the Pontiff or opposed him, they were bestowed with certain rings that, unbeknownst to 
them, would eventually drive them mad with visions of endless combat and turn them into beasts. 
For this reason, outrider knights were seen as exiles unworthy of praise, due to their inevitable 
fate as mere dogs of war for the twisted sorcerer's distant campaigns. Notable members among the 
Outrider Knights were Vordt and a distant daughter of the Irithyllian royal family, both of which 
were sent to conquer Lothric prior to the Undead Curse' resurgence prior to the last true Age of 
Fire's rekindling.

After Aldrich rose from his coffin in the Cathedral of the Deep, he journeyed to the cathedral of 
Anor Londo with McDonnell, where Sulyvahn had imprisoned the god of the Darkmoon Dark Sun Gwyndolin 
and his sister Company Captain Yorshka after taking control of the city.
