# CommonJS Patterns

TODO: Explore the pros and cons of using CommonJS (instead of ESM modules(?))

e.g.
- CommonJS loads modules synchronously
- Browsers do not support CommonJS per se
+ CommonJS is baked into Node.js
+ (module bundlers(?))

## Folder contains the following projects

* The Revealing Module & IIFE patterns used in CommonJS
* A homemade module loader based on CommonJS's module loader
* Demonstration of Circular Dependencies caused by CommonJS's module loader
